# INVESTMENT-FORECAST-VISUALIZER
The application displays static reports of year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the userâ€™s monthly deposits after having opened an account.


What did you do particularly well?

I did a good job on the actual algorithm and implementing basic OOP concepts. I also didn't do too bad when making a simple, easy-to-use program.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  A major component I could implement would be input validation to enhance security and fault tolerance. I could also change my variable names so they are more descriptive.
Additionally, I could also change the visuals so it's easier for the user to understand what is being asked of them. Finally, I could make better in-line comments to improve readability.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The piece of code I found most challenging was the actual algorithm, I understood the math well but the logic wasn't working when I wrote it as code. At one point
I even abandoned the original formula for a new one I found through online readings. When that didn't work the way I wanted it to I went back to the drawing board 
and got the original formula to work as an algorithm as intended. Throughout the process, W3schools was a huge help when attempting to understand my logic errors.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

  I learned a lot from this course, I'd say the biggest impact was understanding basic OOP concepts. This was touched on in Java but I still felt like was lacking
an understanding of the basics. Additionally, it taught me some of the theoretical basics of data structures like maps, even simple programming constructs like
nested loops and pointers, and overall just the fundamentals when learning to write simple algorithms.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I used a lot of comments, especially when it came to the basic algorithm to calculate the monthly earned interest, I broke it down within the loop so that it's
easier to understand by someone looking over my code. I also spaced out the important parts of my code to ensure readability. Lastly, I kept it as simple as possible
to make debugging less complex.
